####Partial open book decomposition

**Definition.** A *proper subsurface* $P$ of a surface $S$ satisfies $S \cap P = \partial S$??? 

**Definition.** An *abstract partial open book* is a triple $(S, P, h)$ where $S$ is a connected surface with boundary, $P$ is a proper subsurface of $S$ (which is a union of 1-handles attached to Sâˆ’ P???), and $h: P \to S$ is an embedding that restricts to the identity near the boundary $\partial P \cap \partial S$.

Everything doesn't make sense...

We can define a 3-manifold $Y$ from a partial open book $(S,P,h)$ by obtaining a Heegaard diagram. First construct a handlebody $S \times [-1,0] / \sim$ and the compression body $P \times [0,1] / \sim$ where $(x,t) \sim (x,t')$ for $x \in \partial S$ and $t \in [-1,1]$. Then glue them together with the maps $i: P \times \{0\} \hookrightarrow S \times \{0\}$ and $h: P \times \{1\} \to S \times \{-1\}$
