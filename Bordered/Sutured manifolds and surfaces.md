**Definition 1.** A *sutured manifold* is a pair $(Y,\Gamma)$ where $Y$ is an oriented 3-manifold with boundary and $\Gamma$ is closed simple curves on $\partial Y$ called *sutures*. Every component of $\partial Y$ contains sutures and $\Gamma$ divides $\partial Y$ into two regions $R_+$ and $R_-$.

There is a 2-dimensional analogue of a sutured manifold.

**Definition 2.** A *sutured surface* is a pair $\mathcal{F}(F,\Lambda)$
