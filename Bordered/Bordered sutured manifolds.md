### Sutured manifolds and surfaces

---
**Definition 1.** A *sutured manifold* is a pair $(Y,\Gamma)$ where $Y$ is an oriented 3-manifold with boundary and $\Gamma$ is a collection of closed simple curves on $\partial Y$ called *sutures*. Every component of $\partial Y$ contains sutures and $\Gamma$ divides $\partial Y$ into two regions $R_+$ and $R_-$.

There is a 2-dimensional analogue of a sutured manifold.

**Definition 2.** A *sutured surface* is a pair $\mathcal{F}=(F,\Lambda)$ where $F$ is an oriented surface with boundary and $\Lambda$ is a collection of points on $\partial F$ called *sutures*. Every component of $\partial F$ contains sutures and $\Lambda$ divides $\partial F$ into two components $S_+$ and $S_-$.

**Definition 3.** Let $\mathcal{F} = (F,\Lambda)$ be a sutured surface. A *dividing set* $\Gamma$ for $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite collection of oriented properly embedded arcs and simple closed curves in $F$ for which $\partial\Gamma = -\Lambda$. Also, $\Gamma$ separates $F$ into two regions $R_+$ and $R_-$ with $\partial{R_\pm} = (\pm\Gamma)\cup S_\pm$.

### Arc diagrams and bordered sutured manifolds

---
**Definition 4.** An *arc diagram* of rank k is a triple $\mathcal{Z} = (Z, a, M)$ where $Z$ is a finite collection of oriented arcs, a set of $2k$ disjoint points
