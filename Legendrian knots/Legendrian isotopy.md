**Theorem 1.** In $(S^3, \xi_{std})$, Legendrian knots $L$ and $L'$ are Legendrian isotopic if and only if the complements of standard neighborhoods are contactomorphic.

---

This theorem can be derived from the following theorem.

---

**Theorem 2.**  For compact subsets $S$ and $S'$ in $(S^3, \xi_{std})$, there is an ambient contact isotopy $\phi_t$ from $S$ to $S'$ if and only if there is a contactomorphism $\psi$ sending $S$ to $S'$.

---

We need some preparation to prove Theorem 2. Let $\textit{Diff}_{std}$ be the group of contactomorphisms of $(S^3, \xi_{std})$ and $\textit{Diff}_p$ be the group of diffeomorphisms fixing $\xi_{std}(p)$, i.e. $\phi^*(\xi(\phi(p))) = \xi(p)$.

**Theorem 3. (Eliashberg)** The following inclusion is a weak homotopy equivalence.

$$i: \textit{Diff}_{std} \hookrightarrow \textit{Diff}_0.$$

**Proposition 4.** $\textit{Diff}_0$ is path-connected.

**Proof.** Suppose $\phi_0, \phi_1:S^3 \rightarrow S^3$ are diffeomorphisms in $\textit{Diff}_0$. By Smale's result, there is an isotopy $\phi_t: S^3 \to S^3$ connecting $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$. Let $\zeta$

**Proof of Theorem 2.** 


Other than $S^3$?
