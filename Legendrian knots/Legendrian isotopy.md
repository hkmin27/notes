**Theorem 1.** In $(S^3, \xi_{std})$, Legendrian knots $L$ and $L'$ are Legendrian isotopic if and only if the complements of standard neighborhoods are contactomorphic.

This theorem follows from

**Theorem 2.**  For compact subsets $S$ and $S'$ in $(S^3, \xi_{std})$, there is an ambient contact isotopy $\phi_t$ from $S$ to $S'$ if and only if there is a contactomorphism $\psi$ sending $S$ to $S'$.
