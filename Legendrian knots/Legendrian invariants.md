### LOSS invariant
Consider an oriented, null-homologous Legendrian knot $L \subset (Y,\xi)$. Then there is an open book decomposition  $(S,\phi)$ compatible with $(Y,\xi)$ such that $L$ sits on $S_{1/2}$ in a homologically essential way. (Why?)

Pick a properly embedded arc $b$ on $S_{1/2}$ intersecting $L$ once. Notice that the disc $D := b \times [0,1]$ is isotopic to a meridional disk of $L$. Orient $b$ so that the boundary orientation of $D$: $b \times \{1\} \cup -b \times \{0\}$ coincides the natural orientation of a meridian of $L$.  Call such $b$ a **half meridian of $L$**.

Pick a basis $\{b_1,...,b_n\}$ of $H_1(S, \partial S)$ such that $b_1$ is a half meridian of $L$. Perturb $b_i$ to $a_i$ so that $a_i$ and $b_i$ intersect once transversely and $(a_i,b_i)$ forms the orientation of $S$. Place the basepoint $z$ on the region that is not swept out by the isotopies of $b_i$, and put $w$ between $a_1$ and $b_1$ close to the tail of $b_1$.
